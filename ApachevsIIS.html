                                 Apache and Internet Information services (IIS) are web servers that are common hosts for websites. These hosts are both fast and reliable, but their methods of hosting and management are very different, this is how the Apache versus IIS debate is fuelled. These two servers have pros and cons, where a web server may be better than the other in one aspect, while the other server may be better in another aspect. Although these web servers are comparable, they should be seen as ‘tools’ for different jobs and whether the user wants a server that can be managed from a configuration file (Apache) or a window-based management program (Internet Information Services).<br><br>
                                 Apache provides service to more people by making it available to those who use UNIX, Linux, Windows and Netware computers. Open source allows the management by a large team that may be in different countries, meaning it is “reconfigurable and open to tinkering” (KnownHost 2013). Apache began in 1995 when Rob McCool has stopped developing his NCSA server httpd. Apache revived Rob McCool’s project and continued with the development by adding new features and fixing bugs. Apache is an open source web server which is managed by a large team of volunteers who aim to create a “robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available source code…server” (Apache 2014).<br><br>
                                 IIS is a web server produced by Microsoft, running mainly on Microsoft Windows OS and is closed source software unlike its market leader, Apache. This web server ‘s development is not slowed down because of being closed source, Microsoft is a large company and could focus their divided attention to supporting IIS, meaning they can easily exceed Apache if it was in their interest.  IIS started as research at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. It was released as freeware but with the large amount of traffic they received, they could not support it, so Microsoft took over the project in 1995 (Kramer 1999).

                              <h4  class="subTitle">Performance</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Apache and IIS are both dependant on the servers’ OS that it will be running on. Apache cannot run on Windows as well as IIS because IIS is designed to run on windows specifically, on the other hand, IIS would not do as well as Apache on a Linux OS. Apache and IIS both allow for the optimization of performance with the use of bandwidth throttling and balancing load. Using Caches allow for an increase of performance by decreasing the amount of processing needed, information has been stored temporarily on the user’s computer so some processing has become redundant. When sharing resources with applications on a Windows and IIS system, an antivirus is needed due to so many viruses made especially for windows, meaning that there will be extra load on the system which could inevitably slow it down. However, Linux and Apache does not need any kind of antivirus software because there are no viruses associated with the system, allowing for less processing, disk space, and boost in speed.

                              <h4  class="subTitle">Stability</h4>
                              <p>
                                 A system’s stability is considered by the up-time or how constant the bandwidth of the system is, if configured properly, both IIS and Apache will be relatively stable. Although, a system is not always stable, sometimes external and internal factors influence the system’s instability.
                              </p>  
                              <p> 
                                 Windows and IIS are closed source so if there may be any faults in the system, it has to keep running with the fault until Microsoft releases a fix. Although, Linux and Apache do not have this problem since they are open source, a fault in the system could be quickly analysed and solved since everyone has access to the code. The open source method also minimizes human error because it is being reviewed thousands of times compared to the closed source method where it’s only being reviewed by a limited group of people.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 If an IIS system is hacked into, the hacker could possibly completely take over the whole system. This is because IIS has to run through a local account. If a properly configured Apache system is hacked into, the hacker will not have complete control over the system.
                              </p>
                              </p>
                              <h4  class="subTitle">Reliability</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Both systems ensure their reliability and operation by incorporating features to help maintain it. Apache provides features to restart based on multiple factors such as failed requests. IIS also provides these features and can “monitor and recycle the process” (Ekesa 2012). This does not allow any requests to fail or drop. Apache is more reliable than IIS because it is has open source code available to everyone and can be fixed much faster in the instance of fault, while IIS is closed and cannot be fixed as fast.

                              <h4  class="subTitle">Setup Costs</h4>
                              <p>
                                 The setup costs between IIS and Apache vary a lot because of the way they run. A Windows and IIS setup needs better hardware to run with antivirus software, also it needs to be licensed which increases costs. A Linux and Apache setup only needs low specification hardware since it can be run through configuration files.
                              </p>
                              <h4  class="subTitle">Maintenance Costs</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Windows and IIS’s maintenance requires everyone who is working on maintaining the system to have a licence, increasing the costs. Apache’s maintenance is done by many volunteers all over the world contributing to the system because it is open source so maintenance does not cost anything.
                              </p>
                              <h4  class="subTitle">Human Resources Costs</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Human resources cost approximately the same between the two systems. When the system is running, it is not likely that further input is needed unless the system’s stability or performance is at risk such as an attack, increased traffic, etc. An experienced administrator will minimize costs because they know exactly what they are doing, which decreases the chance that the system will slow down, successfully attacked, etc. (Doroshko, A 2014).
                              </p>
                              <h4  class="subTitle">Summary</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Although Apache and IIS share similar features, but running a Linux and Apache system would be more advantageous than running a Windows and IIS system.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 The Windows and IIS system would eventually cause if a hacker successfully infiltrates the system they are able to take full control over it. Its closed source so if there may be any faults in the system users will have to wait until Microsoft releases a patch or fix for it. It needs virus protection, because of all the viruses written specifically for it, which puts extra load on the system. The cost of this type of system is very high due to the licences needed to maintain it and more powerful hardware than Apache to support anti-virus and other features.
                              </p>
                              <p>   
                                 However, Apache and Linux OS would not cause all these problems. Apache would not allow a hacker to take control of the whole system if they successfully infiltrated. It is open source so if there are any faults in the system the users would not have to wait long for a fix since so many people will be reviewing the code. Linux and Apache systems have no viruses on this system so there is no need for virus protection, due to this the hardware required should not be as powerful as a Windows and IIS system which would lower the cost of the system.
                              </p>
                              <p>   
                                 My opinion between Apache and IIS would be that Apache has the advantage over IIS. Apache is much cheaper than IIS because IIS needs a windows OS, while Apache can use a free OS like Linux.
                              </p>
