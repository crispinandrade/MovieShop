                                 “A content management system is software that makes it easier to update and manage the content of your website” (Gabriel 2014).It is best used in smaller businesses because one person can update and manage a site themselves very quickly and easily, and is cost effective since the business can directly make changes to the site instead of going back to your agency to edit your site, in the case that the business would not have used a content management system. A content management system is mainly aimed at users who cannot write HTML, who do not want to hand code the site, or who have little experience in the field but still want to create a web page. This takes away the complex part of creating and maintaining a website which allows anyone to do it, also training people to use a content management system would be very cheap and take little time to achieve (Margaret 2014).

                                 There are many different content management systems available, but the most popular content management system systems today are WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Each of these content management system specialise in something such as social networking sites, commerce sites, Blogging sites, etc.

                                 WordPress is an open source content management system that mainly uses PHP and MySQL. Released on 27th May 2003, by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little, it is the most popular content management system in use, at approximately 60 million sites that use it. WordPress has made it to be one of the best content management systems available today due to multiple factors that have attracted people to this piece of software. It is packed with many features that have been refined with each update along the way. On top of that, the updates keep on coming; this allows it to constantly improve which users always love. WordPress allows users to put aside the complex side of the software but still utilize it effectively, this allows users to gradually learn the full extent of what WordPress has to offer while still being able to fully interact with the software. WordPress produces professional looking sites through the use of themes and templates; there are many different themes available, free and premium which look far superior to the free ones. This software is open source which means it is free, although the best features will cost money it is well worth it for what you get and the amount you will pay. Plugins are good quality and are easy to find and install, the majority of the time there will be a plugin that does exactly what you want and is free.

                                 Drupal is another one of the most popular content management systems available, written in January 2001 by Drues Buytaert, is open source which many people prefer since its free and is aimed at people who are more technically experienced in the field since it uses less resources (Vangie 2014).

                                 Drupal is one of that fastest content management systems, its pages load much more quickly and have low ping compared to Joomla and WordPress because it uses less resources but that would change as it gets loaded with extensions and plugins, since they require more resources. Customisation is key in Drupal, it is the most flexible content management system compared to Joomla and WordPress since users can edit almost everything in the program. Drupal is well secured, so much so that government websites have built their sites using Drupal the most popular being http://www.whitehouse.gov/, compared to WordPress, “hackers can target a vulnerability inside a plugin and wipe out hundreds of thousands of sites” and that hackers are actively looking to hack the “WordPress ecosystem”. Similar to the other content management systems, Drupal also has a large community of people maintaining and improving the software which is always good for software as it keeps their users coming back to them (Robert 2014).

                              <h4  class="subTitle">Joomla</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Joomla is the content management system that is balanced between WordPress and Drupal, developed by The Joomla Project Team on 17th August 2005, which enables the user to build applications and sites. It is an open source content management system mainly for web pages, written in PHP and uses object oriented programming .

                                 Joomla is great at creating social networking and commerce sites. Social networking sites are easy and fast to create with Joomla and can be a strong tool to have for your site. Commerce sites are also very fast and easy to create with Joomla since it supports these type of sites the best. The main reason Joomla is so popular is because how easy it is to use, its features, and the fact that it is open source (free). Supporting the main reasons of Joomla’s popularity is that it is very easy to build a web page with little knowledge in web development and can be maintained without much knowledge. It has many templates which allow user’s web pages to look professional and achieves their goal of gaining a professional online presence quickly. The open source software is maintained by one of the largest content management system communities, so solutions are available very quickly by multiple experts. Since Joomla is open source, if a feature is needed and does not already exist that person can contact the community and the feature will be implemented faster than closed source software.

                                 Most people would prefer one content management system over another and swear by it but it seems to be more of which content management system would suit your situation best. Each content management system offers something different and specialises in certain types of sites, such as Drupal specialising in social networking and commerce sites. People who have just started a business would likely choose WordPress as their content management system because their business would be small and since WordPress is easy to maintain by one person it fits well with the small business, WordPress is also very easy to use as it does not require much technical knowledge from its user. For those looking to add a social networking feature to their site, Joomla is ideal for this because it’s very fast and easy. Joomla is also ideal for those without much technical knowledge as Drupal but still offers many features. If you think your site will grow very fast, and will take on a huge amount of traffic from users then Drupal would be the best choice since it’s the fastest content management system compared to WordPress and Joomla because it takes less resources to run, allowing more resources to be allocated to, in this case, supporting the load on the site.

                                 Our hypothetical online DVD rental shop deals with customer’s DVD rentals and customers browsing the DVDs on the site. Drupal would best be suited because it will be a commercial site dealing with customer’s money and taking orders of DVDs, also since the business seems to be expanding, we should expect much more traffic to be coming through to the site. Since Drupal is the fastest content management system out of the three it can handle large amounts of traffic because it uses less resources to function and will allow more resources for the customer’s traffic, the site deals with money so Drupal is a good choice since its security is better than the other content management systems.
